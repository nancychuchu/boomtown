## Personal Learnings

Part 1 of this project trained back-end development skills through setting up a node express app. The app uses GraphQL for data query which provided the practice of creating a schema and setting up the necessary resolvers. The node PG library was used to establish a connection with my Postgres database and helper methods were set up with SQL queries to call data from it. This project also provided experience with using a GraphQL Playground to live test the GraphQL API and debug any errors.
